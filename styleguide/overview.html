<h2 class="sg" name="for-developers">For Developers</h2>
<p class="sg">This site is built using <a href="https://github.com/SC5/sc5-styleguide#build-options" class="sg">SC5 Styleguide</a> which is a project that extends <a href="https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node" class="sg">Node-KSS</a>. Node-KSS is a node.js implementation
of KSS &quot;Knyle Style Sheets&quot; which is syntax for creating comments in your
Scss (or css) and generating Living Style Guide Websites</p>
<p class="sg">To learn how to write documentation for KSS see the <a href="https://github.com/kss-node/kss/blob/spec/SPEC.md" class="sg">KSS Spec</a></p>
<p class="sg">SC5 extends a number of Node-KSS feature and adds fancy search feature and loads the entire styleguide in an angular app. This allows the stylguide in the main website that are documented to not be &quot;polluted&quot; but the styles in the stylguide website.</p>
<p class="sg">CS5 Also add a number of useful features that are in the <a href="https://github.com/SC5/sc5-styleguide#documenting-syntax" class="sg">SC5 Documentation Synatax</a></p>
