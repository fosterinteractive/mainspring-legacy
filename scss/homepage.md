# Living Styleguide #
This is the styleguide that is generated from the build code of this website.

## For Developers ##
This site is built using [SC5 Styleguide](https://github.com/SC5/sc5-styleguide#build-options) which is a project that extends [Node-KSS](https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node). Node-KSS is a node.js implementation
of KSS "Knyle Style Sheets" which is syntax for creating comments in your
Scss (or css) and generating Living Style Guide Websites

To learn how to write documentation for KSS see the [KSS Spec](https://github.com/kss-node/kss/blob/spec/SPEC.md)

SC5 extends a number of Node-KSS feature and adds fancy search feature and loads the entire styleguide in an angular app. This allows the stylguide in the main website that are documented to not be "polluted" but the styles in the stylguide website.

CS5 Also add a number of useful features that are in the [SC5 Documentation Synatax](https://github.com/SC5/sc5-styleguide#documenting-syntax)
